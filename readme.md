Trigger debugger

Is a script ( future mod ) that allows you to activate and track information from triggers mid session in multiplayer en missions

The idea is, if for some reason the trigger fails, you can manually activate it

now:
  - Activate triggers at will

Future:
  - 3d view
  - Menu
  - Modify the trigger in server/mid mission
